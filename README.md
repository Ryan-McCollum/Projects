FinalAnalysisRyanEdit.html: 	Study requested by the President of Miami University to attempt to determine the annual carbon emissions of commuting faculty and students to
Miami University. Using Euclidean distance, research was composed to derive average actual driving distance, average miles per gallon on cars used, and total miles commuted
by each type of commute type to determine the annual total carbon emission.
